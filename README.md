# Why Session-based music recommender system?
The recommender system developed in this project is session-based. Music is usually listened to, in sessions and every session could be a lot different from the last one, even for the same listener. The songs we listen to, in a session could be result of a lot of factors involved like the time of the day, the company we are in, the vibe we are feeling, and so on. Hence it is important to understand that more similar songs are listened to, in the same session.

One with the information of user data and the other that I have used, which contains the music listening history of 1k users with timestamps. The TSV file contains columns including- user ID, timestamp, track ID, track Name, artist ID and artist Name. The columns user ID, track ID, track Name and timestamp are mainly used in this project. Artist information is used to understand if songs belongs to same or similar artists.
